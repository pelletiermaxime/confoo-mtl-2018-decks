# ConFoo MTL 2018 Speaker decks

Lists below all speaker decks from [ConFoo MTL 2018](https://confoo.ca).

Please correct any missing links or errors by opening a PR.

Inspired by https://github.com/dav-m85/confoo-mtl-2017-decks.

I'm way too lazy to fill the session and speaker name manually, so I just used this small script on https://confoo.ca/en/yul2018/schedule:

```javascript
$('.slot').each(function () {
    const $session = $(this).find('.session');
    const sessionTitle = $session.text().trim();
    const sessionUrl = $session.find('a').attr('href');
    console.log(`#### [${sessionTitle}](https://confoo.ca${sessionUrl})`);

    const $speaker = $(this).find('.speaker');
    const speakerName = $speaker.text().trim();
    const speakerUrl = $speaker.find('a').attr('href');
    console.log(`By [${speakerName}](https://confoo.ca${speakerUrl})`);
});
```
